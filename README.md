# Thesis
Real time Object Detection, Tracking, Distance and Speed Estimation for self-driving cars based on Deep Learning using YOLO technique
To run the project, You need to download Yolo weights and place the file in the same folder. Since its a large file I am unable to upload it.
Link to download weights: https://pjreddie.com/yolo/
If you upload a recorded video then run Realtime_output_yolo.py and if you want to run a real time video then run Record_yolo_video_with_iinput.py files
